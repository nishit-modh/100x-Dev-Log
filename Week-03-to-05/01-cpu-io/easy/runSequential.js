// Problem Description – Sequential Execution of Async Functions

// You are given an array of asynchronous functions. Your task is to execute them one by one, ensuring that each function starts only after the previous one has completed. 
// The final result should be an array of resolved values in the same order.
async function runSequential(functions) {
    const arr = []
    for(const fn of functions){
        const res = await fn()
        arr.push(res)
    }
    return arr
}
